  <p>For the New Year, Polycarp decided to send postcards to all his $n$ friends. He wants to make postcards with his own hands. For this purpose, he has a sheet of paper of size $w \times h$, which can be cut into pieces.</p>
  <p>Polycarp can cut any sheet of paper $w \times h$ that he has in only two cases: </p>
  <ul> 
   <li> If $w$ is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size $\frac{w}{2} \times h$; </li>
   <li> If $h$ is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size $w \times \frac{h}{2}$; </li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>If $w$ and $h$ are even at the same time, then Polycarp can cut the sheet according to any of the rules above.</p>
  <p>After cutting a sheet of paper, the total number of sheets of paper is increased by $1$.</p>
  <p>Help Polycarp to find out if he can cut his sheet of size $w \times h$ at into $n$ or more pieces, using only the rules described above.</p>

  <p>The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.</p>
  <p>Each test case consists of one line containing three integers $w$, $h$, $n$ ($1 \le w, h \le 10^4, 1 \le n \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the width and height of the sheet Polycarp has and the number of friends he needs to send a postcard to.</p>

   Output
  </div>
  <p>For each test case, output on a separate line: </p>
  <ul> 
   <li> "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>", if it is possible to cut a sheet of size $w \times h$ into at least $n$ pieces; </li>
   <li> "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>" otherwise. </li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>You can output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>" in any case (for example, the strings <span class="tex-font-style-tt">yEs</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">yes</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Yes</span> and <span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span> will be recognized as positive).</p>

  <p>In the first test case, you can first cut the $2 \times 2$ sheet into two $2 \times 1$ sheets, and then cut each of them into two more sheets. As a result, we get four sheets $1 \times 1$. We can choose any three of them and send them to our friends.</p>
  <p>In the second test case, a $3 \times 3$ sheet cannot be cut, so it is impossible to get two sheets.</p>
  <p>In the third test case, you can cut a $5 \times 10$ sheet into two $5 \times 5$ sheets.</p>
  <p>In the fourth test case, there is no need to cut the sheet, since we only need one sheet.</p>
  <p>In the fifth test case, you can first cut the $1 \times 4$ sheet into two $1 \times 2$ sheets, and then cut each of them into two more sheets. As a result, we get four sheets $1 \times 1$.</p>
